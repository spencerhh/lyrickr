                <p>
                    This is my attempt at combining my current knowledge of web development
                    with something that I'm really passionate about (music). When we were
                    learning about APIs, I began thinking about how I could use some that
                    would really interest me. For this site, I used lyrics.ovh, which is
                    really easy to implement as well as TasteDive (not so easy). These APIs
                    display the lyrics of a song and provide information about the artist.
                    In the future, I plan on providing more information about related artists
                    and the artist's upcoming events. As the site is know, it is very
                    early in its development and I hope to continue working on it and applying
                    my knowledge as it grows.

                    To use this site, simply type in an artist's name and a song they've made. This
                    API is case-insensitive, but the spelling must be exact. Unfortunately, this
                    API doesn't allow for the artist to be featured on the song when searching.
